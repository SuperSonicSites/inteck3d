Service1: Renovation Visualization
Service1_desc: "Renovations and home construction is expensive. Just an average kitchen or bathroom renovation can cost upwards of $25,000. When starting a new project, you want to be confident that you will be satisfied with the result before the building starts! Inteck3D’s services help you identify and solve problems before you get started and give you peace of mind that you WILL indeed be satisfied.<br></br>
If you’re renovating a space to rent it out or use it as a secondary income suite, Inteck’s images and video tours can help you market it before construction is complete. You don’t want to lose money in the gap between finishing the reno project and landing a tenant. Normally, you’d have to let the paint dry, then decorate, photograph the space, put the pictures up on Kijiji and wait for someone to contact you.<br></br>
With Inteck3D, you can advertise your space with detailed pictures of what the finished product will look like before construction even starts. You can land a tenant 2 months prior to reno completion and have them move in a day after the last coat of paint dries. It’s time efficient and saves you money."

service2: "Dream Home Visualization"
service2_desc: "Do you have a vision for your dream home but you’re getting lost in floor plans and 2D drafts? What if you could visualize it without risking expensive errors in construction?<br><br>Our 3D rendered images and tours will help you know exactly what your space is going to look like. You can custom dimensions based on your needs, like moving walls or expanding a hallway or doorway so your couch or king sized mattress can fit through. Problem solving in the visual world is a lot less expensive than fixing problems in real life!<br><br>Aside from identifying problems, Inteck’s services are a designer’s dream! Our software allows you to visualize different styles by swapping out different materials, colour sets, countertops, floorplans, and lighting all on the spot. Want to know how brick tiles will look instead of marble? We can do that! Experiment everything from wood plank size, tile layouts, cuts, crown moldings, cabinetry, door handles, hinges, lighting fixtures, placements, paint, carpet, stairs, railings...the works!<br><br>Our program,Chief Architect, has by far the greatest library of furniture and appliances out there but we can also import data into it as well, meaning you can see what your actual furniture will look like in your dream home!"


service3: Large Project Visualization
service3_desc: "Inteck3D is designed for residential projects, both small projects and large condo and housing developments. Our past projects have included visualizing 80 homes on a plot, 6 four-plexes on a plot, and duplexes. We can help you visualize a frugal but tasteful design that can be produced at high volume, and quickly so you can sell or land tenants fast and make a profit.<br><br>Our Platinum renders are a perfect fit to help you market a professional, detailed, and stunning image to potential prospects before construction is even finished. These high class images and video renders can showcase your properties long before the last coat of paint is applied and dry. A 360 Tour is another excellent resource to let your prospects slowly tour a virtual version of your space and imagine themselves in it, making it their home.<br><br>Use Inteck3D’s services today to help you find buyers or renters for your properties before construction is complete.

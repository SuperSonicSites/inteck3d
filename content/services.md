service2: Home Visualization
service2_desc: "Do you have a vision for your dream home but you’re getting lost in floor plans and 2D drafts? What if you could visualize it without risking expensive errors in construction?<br><br>Our 3D rendered images and tours will help you know exactly what your space is going to look like. You can custom dimensions based on your needs, like moving walls or expanding a hallway or doorway so your couch or king sized mattress can fit through. Problem solving in the visual world is a lot less expensive than fixing problems in real life!<br><br>Aside from identifying problems, Inteck3d’s services are a designer’s dream! Our software allows you to visualize different styles by swapping out different materials, colour sets, countertops, floorplans, and lighting all on the spot. Want to know how brick tiles will look instead of marble? We can do that! Experiment everything from wood plank size, tile layouts, cuts, crown moldings, cabinetry, door handles, hinges, lighting fixtures, placements, paint, carpet, stairs, railings...the works!<br><br>Our program, Chief Architect, has an extensive library of furniture and appliances but we can also import data into it as well, meaning you can see what your actual furniture will look like in your dream home!"

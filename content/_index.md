heading2: PROBIOTICS FOR A HEALTHY HOME<br>AND A CLEAN PLANET
heading2_sub: "Probiotic cleaners use a balance of live bacteria to continue cleaning your home long after the product has been applied. Because bacterias are always changing their DNA, it's nearly impossible to continue creating products that kill them entirely. Just like when you take probiotics to keep your body healthy, they can be used in our living spaces to help clean in a much more sustainable and eco-friendly way. Probiotics are free from harmful and cancerogenic toxins, chemicals, and pathogens.<br><br>Use bacterias to your advantage! It's not unusual for people to think that all bacterias are bad, but that's not true! There are certain types of good bacteria, which are actually essential for our health and the natural balance of our environment. And good bacteria is at the core of probiotic cleaning products from ProfiClean. We take pride in NOT KILLING 99.9% of all living organisms, but rather using nature's own powers to help restore the healthy balance on the surfaces. If you're looking for a healthier and more sustainable way to clean your home or business, learn more about probiotic cleaners and try EkoCleaner products today!"

Ivan Cyr, Inteck’s founder, is excited by the potential of virtual reality technology and loves helping clients visualize their space. He says, “It’s so satisfying to see a client get excited about creating and showcasing their new look. I’m proud to have built a service that can help people sell and market their homes and provide excellent service to others.” Customer service is priority and Ivan firmly believes that Inteck can’t be successful if you aren’t satisfied. Ivan is currently working on getting his BCIN in Ontario.

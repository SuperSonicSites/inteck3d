heading1: We are an environmentally conscious cleaning company in the region of Montreal, QC striving to bring sustainability to our industry and your homes!

about1: "After years in the cleaning business, we developed vast knowledge and expertise, but we also became more and more aware of how harmful conventional cleaners can be and how people were simply refusing to allow them in their homes anymore! <br><br>But finding eco-friendly solutions that would provide truly professional results for our clients proved to be a very difficult task! After searching and searching, we finally ended up developing our own solutions based on expertise and care and specifically selected and designed to tick all sustainability boxes!<br><br>
The EkoAccent product line and the EkoCleaner probiotic cleaning solution were born!<br><br>Our mission is “Saving the Planet One Home at a Time!” and we constantly strive to do exactly that by helping restore the healthy balance in your homes, by creating an environment free of harmful toxins and chemicals regularly contained in the conventional cleaners and by deliberately choosing packaging that helps minimize waste and save resources!<br><br>We use aluminum, glass, and paper and offer a “return for reuse” program for our containers. Our subscription boxes give you everything you need for the green cleaning of your home and are the first (and probably the only) zero-waste green cleaning option on the market! <br><br>Thank you very much for your interest and for helping us save the planet one home at a time!<br><br>We are looking forward to welcoming you into our family of clients."
